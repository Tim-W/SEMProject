Qix (pronounced "kicks") is an arcade game released by Taito America Corporation in 1981. The objective of Qix is to fence off, or claim, a supermajority of the playfield. At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qixâ€”a stick-like entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle.
